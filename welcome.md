# Clean Code Learning Guide

## Introduction
This guide is designed to help you learn and apply key concepts in software development, focusing on SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and Test-Driven Development (TDD). These concepts are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **Concept**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- **Resource**: [Single Responsibility Principle Explained](https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles)

### **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **Concept**: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Resource**: [Open/Closed Principle](https://stackify.com/solid-design-open-closed-principle/)

### **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **Concept**: Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
- **Resource**: [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/solid-class-design-the-liskov-substitution-principle/)

### **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **Concept**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **Resource**: [Interface Segregation Principle](https://www.baeldung.com/java-interface-segregation-principle)

### **D**ependency Inversion Principle
- **Concept**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Resource**: [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://www.baeldung.com/dependency-inversion-principle)

## Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture involves organizing code in such a way that it encapsulates the business logic but keeps it separate from interfaces and infrastructure.

- **Key Concept**: Separation of concerns, independence from UI, database, frameworks, or any external agency.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
TDD is a software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.

### Steps of TDD
1. **Write a Test**: Start by writing a test that defines a function or improvements of a function.
2. **Make it Run**: Write the minimum code necessary to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Optimize the code, while ensuring that tests still pass.
