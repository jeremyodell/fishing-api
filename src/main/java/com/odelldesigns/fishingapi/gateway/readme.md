# Gateway Package

## Overview
The `gateway` package is responsible for data access and external interactions. This package abstracts the data layer and provides a clean separation from the business logic layer.

## Responsibilities
- Implementing data access operations with repositories (e.g., CRUD operations).
- Interacting with databases, external services, or APIs.
- Providing a data transfer mechanism between the business logic and data source.

## Best Practices
- Use Spring Data JPA or similar technologies for data access.
- Ensure separation of concerns by not including business logic in gateways.
- Implement error handling and data validation specific to data access.
