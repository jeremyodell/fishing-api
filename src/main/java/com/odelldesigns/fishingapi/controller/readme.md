# Controller Package

## Overview
This package contains the controller classes of the application. Controllers in Spring Boot are responsible for handling incoming web requests and returning responses to the client. They act as the entry point for interaction with the application's business logic.

## Responsibilities
- Mapping HTTP requests to handler methods using annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
- Validating incoming data and binding it to command or form objects.
- Interacting with service layer to process business logic.
- Handling and responding to exceptions.
- Formatting and sending responses (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML).

## Best Practices
- Keep controllers light and focused on handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Delegate business logic to the service layer.
- Validate incoming requests and handle exceptions gracefully.
