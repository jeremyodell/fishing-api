# Configuration Package

## Overview
The `configuration` package in this Spring Boot application is dedicated to defining beans and configuration settings. This package leverages Spring's `@Configuration` annotation to declare class-based configurations.

## Responsibilities
- Defining bean methods with `@Bean` annotation to instantiate and configure beans.
- Setting up application-specific configurations like database sources, web security, or custom properties.
- Integrating third-party libraries and frameworks by defining their beans and setting properties.

## Best Practices
- Keep configurations modular and organized.
